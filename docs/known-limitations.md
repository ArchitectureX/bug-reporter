# Known Limitations

- Screenshot capture depends on `html2canvas` and may not perfectly render cross-origin iframes.
- Screen recording format defaults to `video/webm`; unsupported codecs fall back best-effort.
- Annotation tools are basic in v1 (rectangle, arrow, text).
- Mobile browsers may restrict screen capture APIs.
